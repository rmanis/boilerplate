# Boilerplate

Simple boilerplate code to make starting a project easier.

Copy/paste anything into your project, and modify as necessary.

## Example:
Say you need to write a server. Start with src/net/server-list.c and
add any handler code you need for when the client connects, sends
input, and disconnects.
